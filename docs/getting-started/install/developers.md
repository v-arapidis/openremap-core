# Developer Setup

For contributors, extractor authors, and anyone who wants to run OpenRemap from source, modify the code, or run the test suite.

---

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Required version | Check |
|---|---|---|
| Python | 3.10+ | `python --version` |
| uv | latest | `uv --version` |
| git | any | `git --version` |

### Install uv

uv manages the virtual environment, dependencies, and Python version automatically.

```bash
# macOS / Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Windows (PowerShell)
winget install astral-sh.uv
```

Full documentation: [docs.astral.sh/uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

### Install git

Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads) or use your system package manager.

---

## Clone and set up

```bash
git clone https://github.com/v-arapidis/openremap-core.git
cd openremap-core
uv sync
```

`uv sync` creates a virtual environment at `.venv/` inside the project folder, installs all dependencies, and pins them to the exact versions in `uv.lock`. It does not affect anything outside the project folder.

### Build the Rust native extension

The performance-critical core (checksum engine, map scanner, diff, entropy,
and the migrated hot loops) is a **mandatory** Rust extension — there is no
pure-Python fallback. Build it once after cloning, and again after any Rust
change:

```bash
uv run maturin develop --release
```

You need a Rust toolchain (`rustup`): [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).
The extension lives in `openremap/_rs/`; if the CLI behaves differently than
the source suggests, the installed extension is stale — rebuild it.

---

## Running commands

You have two options after `uv sync`.

### Option A — prefix with `uv run` (no activation needed)

```bash
uv run openremap identify ecu.bin
uv run openremap scan ./my_bins/
uv run pytest
```

`uv run` automatically activates the project environment for that single call. This works from anywhere inside the project folder and requires no setup step.

### Option B — activate the environment once per session

```bash
# macOS / Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

# Windows (Command Prompt)
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat

# Windows (PowerShell)
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

After activation, the bare command works for the rest of the terminal session:

```bash
openremap identify ecu.bin
pytest
```

Run `deactivate` to leave the environment, or just close the terminal.

> 💡 For interactive use, just run `openremap` (or `uv run openremap`) with no arguments to launch the TUI.

---

## Running the test suite

```bash
uv run pytest tests/ -q
```

All tests must pass before submitting a pull request. Expected output on a clean install:

```
5,692 passed, 12 skipped, 1 xfailed in X.XXs
```

To run a specific test file:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/tuning/manufacturers/test_edc17_extractor.py -v
```

## Project structure

```
openremap-core/
├── openremap/
│   ├── cli/
│   │   └── commands/       ← identify.py, scan.py, cook.py, health.py, etc.
│   ├── core/
│   │   ├── manufacturers/  ← one sub-package per OEM (Bosch, Siemens, …)
│   │   │   └── bosch/
│   │   │       └── edc17/  ← extractor.py + patterns.py per family
│   │   └── services/       ← domain folders: identify/, checksums/,
│   │       │                  maps/, recipes/ (+ entropy.py at root)
│   │       └── …
│   └── _rs/                ← Rust native extension (mandatory)
│       └── src/            ← primitives/, identify/, maps/, checksums/, recipes/
├── tests/                  ← mirrors the package layout
├── notes/                  ← private dev folder (gitignored — not in the repo)
├── pyproject.toml
└── uv.lock
```

The most impactful contribution is adding a new ECU extractor — every new family added makes the full pipeline (identify, scan, recipe, validate, patch) work for that family automatically. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../../CONTRIBUTING.md) for a full step-by-step guide.

## Shell completion (development install)

```bash
uv run openremap --install-completion
```

Restart your terminal after running this.

---

## Updating dependencies

```bash
git pull
uv sync
```

`uv sync` installs any new or changed dependencies automatically.

---

## Publishing a release

Releases are built and published from the project root:

```bash
uv build
uv publish
```

Artifacts appear in `dist/`.
