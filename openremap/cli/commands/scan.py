openremap scan [DIRECTORY]

Batch ECU binary scanner.

Processes every file in a directory through all registered extractors and
sorts each file into one of five destination sub-folders:

  scanned    — exactly one extractor claimed the file AND a match_key was extracted
  sw_missing — exactly one extractor claimed the file BUT match_key is None
  contested  — more than one extractor claimed the file
  unknown    — no extractor could handle the file
  trash      — file does not have a .bin, .ori, or .hex extension

Running without any flags performs a safe dry-run preview — nothing is moved.
Pass --move to actually sort files. Pass --organize to sort into
manufacturer/family sub-folders (e.g. scanned/Bosch/EDC17/) and create all
required directories automatically.

Examples:
    openremap scan                                   # dry-run in current directory
    openremap scan ./my_bins/                        # dry-run in a specific directory
    openremap scan ./my_bins/ --move                 # sort files (flat folders must exist)
    openremap scan ./my_bins/ --move --create-dirs   # sort, creating flat folders first
    openremap scan ./my_bins/ --move --organize      # sort into manufacturer/family tree
    openremap scan ./my_bins/ --organize             # preview the organized layout
    openremap scan ./my_bins/ --report report.json   # dry-run + write JSON report
    openremap scan ./my_bins/ --report report.csv    # dry-run + write CSV report

    Unlike the live identifier (which stops at the first match), all extractors

      - No claimants              → unknown

    their match_key is driven by calibration_id instead. Routing on match_key
