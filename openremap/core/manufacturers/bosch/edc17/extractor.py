        Exclusion guards (in priority order):
          1. EDC16 bins — rejected by two independent checks:
               a. File size is one of the three known EDC16 sizes (256KB /
                  1MB / 2MB) AND the \xde\xca\xfe header magic is present at
                  any of the standard active-section offsets for that size.
                  This is the same anchor that BoschEDC16Extractor uses as
                  its primary positive signal, so the two extractors are now
                  strictly disjoint.
               b. Safety net: if the magic check somehow misses (partially
                  erased bin), any EDC16 family string in the first 512KB
                  still causes rejection here.
             Both guards are needed because b"EDC16" was intentionally removed
             from DETECTION_SIGNATURES to prevent double-claiming, so we must
             never accidentally accept a real EDC16 bin via another signature
             (e.g. b"Bosch" embedded in the calibration area).
          2. EDC15 bins — rejected by the TSW string at the bank boundary.
             BoschEDC15Extractor runs before this extractor in the registry;
             this check is a safety net only.
