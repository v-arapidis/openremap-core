class DetectionStrength(str, Enum):
    """
    How confident the extractor's ``can_handle()`` detection is.

    .. deprecated::
        Static detection strength is superseded by evidence-based detection.
        Extractors should populate ``_last_evidence`` in ``can_handle()``
        instead.  The confidence scorer now computes a dynamic bonus from
        the evidence tag count, falling back to this static value only
        when no evidence tags are present (i.e. the extractor has not been
        upgraded yet).

    The confidence scorer uses this to award a baseline bonus that reflects
    the quality of the match *before* any extracted fields are examined.

    Guidelines for choosing a value:

    ``STRONG``
        4+ detection phases including unique byte signatures, structural
        checks (header magic, pointer tables, sync markers), and multiple
        confirmation steps.  False positives are essentially impossible.
        Examples: EDC17 (5 exclusion guards + signature scan), Multec S
        (6-phase: size + boot block + HC12 pointer table + exclusion +
        SW validation + GM PN validation), IAW 1AV (6-phase).

    ``MODERATE``
        2–3 detection phases with good — but not watertight — signatures.
        Examples: LH-Jetronic (exclusion + string signatures + anchor),
        EMS2000 (size + exclusion + header magic), SID803 (size +
        exclusion + detection signatures).

    ``WEAK``
        Minimal checks, mostly heuristic.  The detection *works* but
        relies on a small number of short byte patterns without strong
        structural confirmation.
        Examples: M3.x (exclusion + signature scan only, no size gate),
        ME9 (single anchor string), PPD (exclusion + signature scan).

class BaseManufacturerExtractor(ABC):
    """
    Abstract base class for ECU manufacturer-specific binary extractors.

    Subclass this for each manufacturer and implement:
      - name         : Human-readable manufacturer name
      - can_handle() : Detect if a binary belongs to this manufacturer
      - extract()    : Extract all identifying information from the binary

    Evidence-based detection
    ------------------------
    ``can_handle()`` returns ``bool`` for backward compatibility, but
    extractors should collect *evidence tags* that describe **why** the
    binary matched and store them via ``self._set_evidence(tags)``.

    After ``can_handle()`` returns ``True``, callers can read
    ``extractor.last_detection_evidence`` to obtain the evidence tuple.
    The confidence scorer uses the evidence count to compute a dynamic
    detection-quality bonus that replaces the static ``detection_strength``
    class attribute.

    Standard evidence tags are defined as module-level constants
    (``SIZE_MATCH``, ``MAGIC_MATCH``, ``FAMILY_STRING``, etc.).
    Extractors may also emit free-form strings for family-specific checks.

    Migration guide
    ---------------
    To upgrade an extractor to evidence-based detection:

    1. At the top of ``can_handle()``, create a local list::

           evidence: list[str] = []

    2. After each successful check, append the appropriate tag::

           evidence.append(SIZE_MATCH)

    3. On every ``return True`` path, call::

           self._set_evidence(evidence)
           return True

    4. On every ``return False`` path, call::

           self._set_evidence()
           return False

    Extractors that have NOT been upgraded yet will have an empty evidence
    tuple, and the confidence scorer will fall back to the static
    ``detection_strength`` class attribute.

    Opt-in fallback key
    -------------------
    Some ECU architectures do not store a software_version in the binary at
    all (e.g. Bosch LH-Jetronic Format A).  For those families the base
    build_match_key() would always return None, making DB lookup impossible.

    Set the class attribute ``match_key_fallback_field`` to the name of the
    extraction dict field that should be used as the version component of the
    match key *only when software_version is absent*.

    Example — LH-Jetronic Format A uses calibration_id as the sole identifier:

        match_key_fallback_field = "calibration_id"

    The default value is None, which preserves the original behaviour for
    every extractor that does not explicitly opt in: if software_version is
    absent the match key remains None.

    Rules
    -----
    - software_version always wins when present — the fallback is never
      consulted if sw is non-empty.
    - The fallback is only used when the value it names is non-empty.
    - All other extractors are completely unaffected.

    To add the fallback to a future extractor (any manufacturer):
        1. Set  match_key_fallback_field = "<field_name>"  in the subclass.
        2. Make sure extract() populates that field in the returned dict.
        3. Pass the field's value to build_match_key() via the
           ``fallback_value`` keyword argument (see BoschLHExtractor for the
           reference implementation).
